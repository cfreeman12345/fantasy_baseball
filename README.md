# fantasy_baseball
I play in a fantasy baseball league, in which each team is matched up against one other team for each week of the season.  Wins and losses are determined by different categories (14 in total), where a win is recorded if your team does better than your opponent in that particular category by the end of the week (i.e scores more runs or records more strikeouts).  There is luck involved, as one team may have opponents that put up significantly better stats than another team's opponents.  In order to reduce the luck factor, this project simulates the season if each team was simultaneously paired against every other team each week, and records an "expected" winning percentage.  It then displays what the "expected" standings should be, based on these win percentages.
